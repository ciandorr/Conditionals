$\prob$ is a de Finetti measure over functions from some set $\universe$ to the reals

We inductively define $\newprob_{\alpha}$, over the functions to the reals from the set of $\alpha$-sequences of members of $\universe$.

$\newprob_0(f)$ = $f(\seq{})$ (the domain here is just the unit set of the null sequence.)

$\newprob_{\alpha+1}(f) = \newprob_\alpha(\lambda \sigma_\alpha(\prob(\lambda w(f(\sigma \concatenate w)|\lambda w(w \nin \sigma_\alpha))))|)$

$\newprob_\lambda (S) = \lim_{\alpha \rightarrow \lambda} \newprob_\alpha (\set{\sigma_\alpha|some sequence in S begins with \sigma_\alpha})$

extend $\newprob_\lambda$ to general functions in the usual way.
